## üö© Notes for the Reviewer

### 1. **Skipping Unit Tests**
I have chosen to skip writing unit tests for this assignment. While I have a basic understanding of writing simple unit tests, I am not highly experienced in this area yet. Testing is something I am actively working to improve on, and it‚Äôs a skill I‚Äôm keen to develop further.  

If the lack of unit tests is a concern, I would greatly appreciate feedback on how to improve my approach.

### 2. **Potential Improvements**
During the development process, I identified a few enhancements that could improve the app's functionality and user experience. However, I did not implement these changes as I wasn‚Äôt sure if they aligned with the requirements:

- **Adding Query Search and Page to the URL**  
  - This feature would allow users to copy and share the app's URL, and others would see the same search results or page when they open the link.
  - **Interactive Search Conflict**: Since the assignment requires interactive search (updating results as the user types), dynamically updating the URL could lead to frequent URL changes and a less optimal experience.
  - **Suggested Solution**:  
    If this feature is required, I suggest adding a **Search** button instead of automatic updates. Users could type their query, click "Search," and the app would update the URL and load the results. Additionally, a dropdown or suggestions list below the search bar could improve the experience.

### 3. **Final Thoughts**
I have done my best to meet the requirements of the assignment with the skills and time available. While there are areas for improvement, I hope the submitted work showcases my problem-solving approach and dedication.  

Regardless of the outcome, I‚Äôd greatly appreciate written feedback on the assignment. If I don‚Äôt meet your expectations, there‚Äôs no need for a follow-up call from my side. Constructive feedback alone would be highly valuable for me to improve.
